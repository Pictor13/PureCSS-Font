# Pure CSS Font
A customizable, scalable font made entirely of css and html.

For private, SEO-hidden, CAPTCHA-friendly unselectable text. Deter plagiarism and spambots!

The theme is based on em units, so it scales in size like any other font.
Its color will also be inherited according to its parents color attribute.
