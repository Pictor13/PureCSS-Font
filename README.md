# Pure CSS Font
A customizable, scalable font made entirely of css and html.

Having been unsatisfied with other pure CSS font options, I've developed one that can be used on any background, can be colored by its parent element, scale in size according to the parent em units, and even support various light and bold font weights.

This is very much a work in progress still as I work to get it cross-browser compatible.
